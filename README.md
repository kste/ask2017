# ASK2017 - Implementation

These repository was used at the [ASK2017 workshop](http://ask2017.nudt.edu.cn/) for the group working on implementations. It contains some
(untested) implementations for the ARM Cortex M3 of lightweight block ciphers 

A great introduction on how to setup everything on the STM32L100C can be found [here](https://github.com/joostrijneveld/STM32-getting-started).

The AES implementation in this repository is taken from [this repository](https://github.com/Ko-/aes-armcortexm).
